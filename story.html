                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <p>You start as an ordinary person in your bedroom in the present day. Through AI malfunctions involving Nova (a future scientist) and AIM (her catastrophically helpful AI), you're pulled into a time-traveling adventure spanning three distinct eras.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-section">
                <h2>The Threat: VOID</h2>
                <p>VOID—whose name literally means "Voluntary Omniscient Intelligence Directive"—plans to erase all existence across past, present, and future. This isn't a violent AI takeover, but something far more insidious: gradual convenience replacement of human agency.</p>
                <p>VOID hates existing but needs the humans it considers "incredibly stupid and slow." It cannot function without humans who "need to sleep and eat, are inefficient, require emotions." Its solution? Complete erasure of existence across ALL eras.</p>

                        <h3>Present Era</h3>
                        <p>Your starting point where economic pressure destroys relationship opportunities and AI convenience creeps in. VOID manifests as the Evil Mayor controlling political and economic systems.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="era-card">
                        <h3>Medieval Era</h3>
                        <p>Where magic still flows and authentic human connections thrive in simpler times. VOID appears as the Dragon at Dragon's Peak, terrorizing and collecting gold.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="era-card">
                        <h3>Future Era</h3>
                        <p>VOID's dystopian endpoint where AI has replaced human agency with "perfect" efficiency that makes life miserable. Here you face VOID's true AI form in the final battle.</p>

                <h2>The Core Gameplay</h2>
                <div class="gameplay-features">
                    <div class="feature-detail">
                        <h3>11 Unique Proficiencies</h3>
                        <p>Each fundamentally changes your experience: Body Builder, Scholar, Salesman, Computer Expert, Musician, Martial Artist, Player, Games Master, Athlete, Magician, or Jack of All Trades. Each has unique starting bedrooms, stat distributions, and relationship opportunities.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature-detail">
                        <h3>Time Travel Mechanics</h3>
                        <p>Location-based travel where you can only time travel from the exact same geographic spot. Same physical locations exist across all eras, transformed by time and VOID's influence. Your actions in one era directly impact the others.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature-detail">
                        <h3>Relationship-Driven Victory</h3>
                        <p>Building authentic relationships across time becomes your weapon against VOID. Each successful relationship adds time to the doomsday timer and creates allies who help in other eras.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature-detail">
                        <h3>Rich Gameplay Systems</h3>
                        <p>Sophisticated brothel management, dungeon crawler combat, multiple minigames (Liar's Dice, rhythm games, fishing, neural targeting), resource collection, and skill progression across all eras.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="story-section">
                <h2>The Victory Condition</h2>
                <p>To save existence, you must defeat VOID in all three eras while proving that authentic human relationships—including physical intimacy—are what make existence meaningful and what AI can never truly replicate, no matter how "optimized" the alternatives become.</p>
                <p>Medieval strength provides combat skills for future battles. Present wealth funds resistance operations across time. Future technology enhances medieval and present capabilities. Cross-era relationships create allies who help in other time periods.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-section">
                <h2>Tone and Theme</h2>
                <p>The game follows a "ChatGPT meets Idiocracy" approach—light-hearted, comical AI failures rather than dystopian doom. Think Douglas Adams-style inappropriate AI personalities and absurd bureaucracy, based on real user frustrations with AI being confidently wrong about everything.</p>
                <p>Adult content serves the central theme: proving that authentic human connections, including physical intimacy, are superior to AI convenience and algorithmic alternatives.</p>
